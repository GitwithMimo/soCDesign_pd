## DAY-1: Overview of open source EDA OpenLANE and Sky130PDK

####OpenLANE
OpenLANE is an open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tool that provides a complete flow for the digital integrated circuit (IC) design from RTL (Register-Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II, a standard file format for IC layout). It is designed to automate the process of physical design, which includes various steps such as synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and verification.

Here are some key points about OpenLANE:

Open Source: OpenLANE is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software.

Integrated Flow: It integrates several open-source tools to provide a complete physical design flow. Some of the tools used include Yosys for synthesis, OpenSTA for static timing analysis, Magic for layout, Netgen for LVS (Layout Versus Schematic), and Fault for DRC (Design Rule Checking).

Technology Independence: OpenLANE is designed to be technology-agnostic, meaning it can be adapted to different semiconductor manufacturing processes with the appropriate technology files.

Automation: The tool aims to automate the physical design process, reducing the need for manual intervention and expertise in each step of the flow.

Community Support: OpenLANE is backed by a community of developers and users who contribute to its development and provide support through forums and documentation.

Cross-Platform: It is designed to run on Linux-based systems, which is the standard operating environment for most EDA tools.

Documentation and Tutorials: OpenLANE comes with comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help users get started with the tool and understand its capabilities.

Contributions: The project welcomes contributions from the community, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements to the existing flow.

Applications: OpenLANE can be used for educational purposes, research, and even for small-scale commercial projects. It is particularly useful for academics and hobbyists who may not have access to expensive commercial EDA tools.

Ecosystem: OpenLANE is part of a larger ecosystem of open-source EDA tools and is often used in conjunction with other tools like OpenROAD for detailed routing and OpenPhySyn for physical synthesis.
